This bash script polls the rss feed for a few nasa websites which post images often. As soon as an image is uploaded by NASA, it is downloaded and set as a wallpaper.

TODO List:
1. Add a few more urls
2. Add a mechanism to make stopping the processes easy. How to distinguish root from children??
3. Generalize the url and image dir.
